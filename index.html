<h1>Happy Mother's Day
    <span id="name"> Mama! </span>
    </h1>
    <h2>Have a very very very happy Mother's Day Mama!</h2>
    <p>Everyday you keep me safe and warm and loved and fed
        But today's your special day, it was my turn instead
        So I got up at 5:00 a.m., I been working hard since then
        Some things I didn't get quite right next year I'll try again
        Just for you I did my best to cut my own hair
        Some places came out pretty good and some are kind of bare
        I washed all your nicest clothes but the washer wasn't free
        So I used the dish washer, pretty smart of me
        Remember no one's perfect, every kid has faults
        Remember it's the thought that counts more than the results
        My heart was in the right place even though I did it wrong
        It was all to say, on mother's day, my love for you is strong!</p>
